Title: Longitudinal Image Analysis and Inference
 
Abstract: We propose massive univariate generalized linear mixed effects models for studies that collect images at multiple visit. Joint inference for fixed effects is conducted using bootstrap of study participants while for random effects we use leave-one-in bootstrap. For conducting inference and sample size calculation we propose to use the upstrap, which samples with replacement either more or fewer samples than the original sample size.
