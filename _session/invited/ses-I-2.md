      title: Bayesian Inference for Stationary Points in Gaussian Process Regression Models with Applications to ERP Analysis
      abstract: Stationary points embedded in the derivatives are often critical for a model to be interpretable and may be considered as key  features of interest in many applications. We propose a semiparametric Bayesian model to efficiently infer the locations of stationary points  of a nonparametric function, while treating the function itself as a  nuisance parameter. We use Gaussian processes as a flexible prior for  the underlying function and impose derivative constraints to control  the function's shape via conditioning. We illustrate the proposed  methods using simulations and then apply the method to the estimation  of event-related potentials (ERP) derived from electroencephalography  (EEG) signals. We show how the proposed method automatically  identifies characteristic components and their latencies at the  individual level, avoiding the excessive averaging across subjects  which is routinely done in the field to obtain smooth curves. By  applying this approach to EEG data collected from younger and older  adults during a speech perception task, we are able to demonstrate how  the time course of speech perception processes change with age.
